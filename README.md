Prototype of the physics levels


TODO::
Develop a way to build the levels using XML, because im lazy.

Develop a way to save the level inforamtion so that it can be saved and loaded.

Add a way to allow the user to rotate the draggable objects, im thinking double tap opens the "Transform tools", allows for rotation, flip horizontal, flip vertical and remove/delete.
